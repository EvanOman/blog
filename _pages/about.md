intro: |
  I'm Evan Oman. I write about day-to-day software engineering, with a focus on pragmatic coding agents.
---

I’ve spent the last few years experimenting with coding copilots, code-review bots, and autonomous task runners. This blog collects my notes, experiments, and the messy lessons that pile up while shipping production software with those tools.

Expect:

- Build logs and retro notes from real automation projects
- Tutorials for wiring agents into everyday developer workflows
- Deep dives on safety guardrails, evals, and observability for autonomous coding systems
