Every dev shop I work with wants AI pair programmers that slot into existing CI/CD pipelines without blowing up reliability. <!--more--> The catch: most guidance out there reads like marketing copy rather than a field manual.

This site is my lab notebook. I plan to document:

1. **Agent-first workflows** – wiring runners into task trackers, coverage bots, and chat bridges.
2. **Safety rails** – constraint templates, guard functions, and human-in-the-loop approval steps.
3. **Diagnostics** – telemetry, eval suites, and regression catchers built for autonomous code contributions.

If that sounds interesting, subscribe via RSS or ping me on GitHub. More soon.
